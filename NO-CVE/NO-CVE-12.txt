2. CREDITS
----------
The vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
Inshell Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Aoop CMS v0.3.6, older versions may be affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
Aoop CMS v0.3.6 is affected by multiple SQL-Injection and Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerabilites.


## SQL-Injection Vulnerabilities ##

Pre-Auth:
http://localhost/index.php?print=download&page=Photos&sub=loadAndShowPhoto&picId=[SQLi]

Post-Auth:
http://localhost/index.php?page=users&sub=readMessage&msgId=[SQLi]
http://localhost/index.php?page=users&sub=newMessage&messageId=[SQLi]
http://localhost/index.php?page=users&sub=deleteMessage&messageId=[SQLi]
http://localhost/index.php?page=EProjects&sub=editRFC&rfcId=[SQLi]&projectId=18

Due to improper input - validation of these GET parameters, an attacker
could inject own arbitrary SQL statements without or with required
authentication. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could
result in a complete database / web-application compromise or data theft.


## Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities ##

Non-Persistent (GET):
http://localhost/index.php?page=Photos&sub=search&pattern="><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>

Non-Persistent (POST):
http://localhost/index.php?page=Photos&sub=search (Field:
"Pattern",payload="><script>alert(1)</script>)

Due to improper input - validation of these GET/POST parameters, an
attacker could temporarily inject arbitrary code using required user
interaction into the context of the website/current browser session.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows for example
session hijacking or client side context manipulation.


Persistent:
http://localhost/index.php?page=users&sub=extendUserProfile (Field:
"profileItemName", "profileItemValue">
http://localhost/index.php?page=EProjects&sub=viewProject&projectId=18
(Field: "name","official_link")
http://localhost/index.php?page=Photos&sub=uploadPic (Field: "Title")

Due to improper input - validation of these input fields, an attacker
could permanently inject arbitrary code using an own registered
user-account into the context of the website. Successful exploitation of
these vulnerabilities allows for example session hijacking or server
side context manipulation.
