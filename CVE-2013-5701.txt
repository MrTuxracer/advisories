2. CREDITS
----------
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Watchguard Server Center v11.7.4
Watchguard Server Center v11.7.3
and other older versions may be affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
An insecure library loading vulnerability has been identified in different
components of the Watchguard Server Center v11.7.4.

The application installs two services "Watchguard Log Collector"
(%installdir%\wsm11\wlcollector\bin\wlcollector.exe)
and "Watchguard WebBlocker Server"
(%installdir%\wsm11\wbserver\bin\wbserver.exe).

Both application services use a fixed path to look for specific files or
libraries. This path includes directories that may not be trusted or under
user control.

By placing a custom version of a library in the application path, the
program will load it before the legitimate version. This allows an attacker
to inject custom code that will be run with the privilege of the program or
user executing the program. The following libraries could be hijacked on
this way:

wgpr.dll

Since both services are running using the SYSTEM account, this may allow a
less privileged user to gain access to SYSTEM privileges. A local attacker
or compromised process is able to put a malicious application library into
the directory which will be executed after a service restart.

On a default installation (%programfiles%\Watchguard) of the Watchguard
Server Center on Windows Vista and above the directory permissions disallow
an low-privileged attacker to mount the attack.

On a default installation (%programfiles%\Watchguard) of the Watchguard
Server Center on Windows XP, the attacker needs to have at least Power User
rights to successfully mount the attack.

On a non-default installation of the Watchguard Server Center to a
directory, which is writeable by a low-privileged user, the attack can be
mounted successfully without any restrictions.

6. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (CODE / EXPLOIT)
------------------------------------
Use the following code to exploit the vulnerability:

#include <windows.h>

#define DLL_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif

void DLL_EXPORT wgpr_library_get()
{
    WinExec("calc",0);
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif


6. SOLUTION
-----------
Administrators who installed the Watchguard Server Center on WinXP or
outside the default installation folder, should harden the directories
permissions (administrative write permissions only) on the mentioned
folders to lower the attack risk.
