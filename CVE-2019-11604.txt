2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Quest KACE Systems Management Appliance 9.0 and below


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
The KACE Systems Management Appliance (SMA) helps you accomplish these goals
by automating complex administrative tasks and modernizing your unified endpoint
management approach. This makes it possible for you to inventory all hardware
and software, patch mission-critical applications and OS, reduce the risk of
breach, and assure software license compliance. So youâ€™re able to reduce systems
management complexity and safeguard your vulnerable endpoints.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The script "/service/kbot_service_notsoap.php" is vulnerable to an unauthenticated
reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when user-supplied input to the
HTTP GET parameter "METHOD" is processed by the web application. Since the
application does not properly validate and sanitize this parameter, it is
possible to place arbitrary script code onto the same page.

The following Proof-of-Concept triggers this vulnerability:
https://127.0.0.1/service/kbot_service_notsoap.php?METHOD=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>


6. RISK
=======
To successfully exploit this vulnerability an unauthenticated or authenticated
user must be tricked into visiting an arbitrary website.

The vulnerability can be used to temporarily embed arbitrary script code into the
context of the appliance web interface, which offers a wide range of possible
attacks such as redirecting the user to a malicious page, spoofing content on the
page or attacking the browser and its plugins. Since all session-relevant cookies
are protected by HTTPOnly, it is not possible to hijack sessions.


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to Quest KACE Systems Management Appliance 9.1
