GPSMapEdit 1.1.73.2 - '.lst' Denial of Service

GPSMapEdit is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using the vulnerable control. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

GPSMapEdit 1.1.73.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
