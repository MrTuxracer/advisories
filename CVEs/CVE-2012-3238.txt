3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
Astaro Security Gateway v8.304, older versions are affected too.


4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
A Persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability has been found on the
Astaro Security Gateway product.

The vulnerability is located in the backup-function of the software:

Vulnerable Module(s):
+Management -> Backup/Restore
 Parameter: "Comment (optional)"

The input field "Comment (optional)" is shown on the "Available backups"
view after successful creation of a new backup and is also included into
the backup-file itself.

Due to improper input - validation of this input field, an attacker
could permanently inject arbitrary code with required user interaction
into the context of the firewall-interface. Successful exploitation of
the vulnerability allows for example cookie theft, session hijacking or
server side context manipulation.


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (CODE / EXPLOIT)
------------------------------------
An attacker needs to force the victim to import an arbitrary
backup-file. The victim does not need to apply the backup, only the
import is required to exploit the vulnerability.
