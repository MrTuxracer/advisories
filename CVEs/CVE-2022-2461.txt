3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Transposh WordPress Translation 1.0.8.1 and below


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Transposh translation filter for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog
translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic translation with human
translation aided by your users with an easy to use in-context interface.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
When installed Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of these
is the "Who can translate" setting under the "Settings" tab, which by default
allows "Anonymous" users to add translations via the plugin's "tp_translation"
ajax action.

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to add translations to
the WordPress site and thereby influence what is actually shown on the site.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT

The following Proof-of-Concept adds a new translation
