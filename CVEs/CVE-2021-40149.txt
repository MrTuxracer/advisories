5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The web server of the E1 Zoom camera through 3.0.0.716 discloses its SSL private

An unauthenticated attacker can abuse this with network-level access to the
camera to download the webserver's private SSL key by simply going to the
following URL:

http://[CAM-IP]/self.key


6. RISK
=======
An unauthenticated attacker can download the webserver's SSL private key and
thereby attack the encrypted network traffic to and from the camera, which might
lead to the disclosure of the administrative access credentials and other
sensitive information.

===========
None.
