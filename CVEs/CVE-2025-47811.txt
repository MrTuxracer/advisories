1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        Wing FTP Server
Vendor URL:     https://www.wftpserver.com
CWE:            Incorrect Default Permissions [CWE-276]
Date found:     2025-05-12
Date published: 2025-06-30
CVSSv4 Score:   8.4 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
CVE:            CVE-2025-47811


2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
WingFTP Server <= 7.4.4


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Wing FTP Server is a free, easy-to-use, and secure FTP server software for Windows,
Linux, and Mac OS. It supports multiple file transfer protocols, including FTP, FTPS,
HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP, giving your clients flexibility in how they connect to the
server. And it provides admins with a web-based interface to administrate the server
from anywhere. You can also monitor server performance and online sessions and even
receive email notifications about various events taking place on the server.

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
Wing FTP server runs as root on Linux and NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on Windows by default.
There is no form of isolation, jail or dropping of rights even for anonymous user accounts.
Combined with a vulnerability like CVE-2025-47812, or any of the legitimate functionality
such as executing commands from the administrative web interface, will ultimately result
in code execution with the highest possible rights. Since an administrative FTP user is
not necessarily also an operating system administrator, we believe that the server provides
overly broad permissions to any user.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
A payload to exploit this vulnerability using the /admin_webservice.html endpoint looks
like the following: 

admin=admin&pass=password&cmd=os.execute('cmd.exe%20%2Fc%20whoami%20%3E%20C%3A%5C%5Cout.txtâ€™)
