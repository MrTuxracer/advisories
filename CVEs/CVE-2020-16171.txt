2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Acronis Cyber Backup v12.5 Build 16327
and probably below.


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Businesses can be at risk of losing important data. Lost data leads to costly
downtime, customer dissatisfaction, regulatory fines, and lost revenue. As a
result, IT pros must meet extremely high expectations. You need to keep the
company running 24-hours a day.

Acronis Cyber Backup delivers the data protection that meets todayâ€™s demands. It
keeps your business running, protecting any workload, scaling without limits,
and saving you money.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
All API endpoints running on port 9877 under "/api/ams/" whereof some are
reachable without authentication, do accept an additional custom header called
"Shard":

def get_ams_address(headers):
    if 'Shard' in headers:
        [...]
        return headers.get('Shard')  # Mobile agent >= ABC5.0

The value of this header is afterwards to construct a separate web request send
by the application using a urllib.request.urlopen call:

def make_request_to_ams(resource, method, data=None):
    port = config.CONFIG.get('default_ams_port', '9892')
    uri = 'http://{}:{}{}'.format(get_ams_address(request.headers), port, resource)
    logging.debug('Making request to AMS %s %s', method, uri)
    headers = dict(request.headers)
    del headers['Content-Length']
    if not data is None:
        headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    req = urllib.request.Request(uri,
                                 headers=headers,
                                 method=method,
                                 data=data)
    resp = None
    try:
        resp = urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=wcs.web.session.DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error('Cannot access ams {} {}, error: {}'.format(method, resource, e))
    return resp

This can be abused to conduct SSRF attacks against otherwise unreachable internal hosts
of Acronis services that are bound to localhost such as the "NotificationService" running
on 127.0.0.1:30572 with a request header like:

Shard: localhost:30572/external_email?

For more details, see the referenced blog post.


6. RISK
=======
The vulnerability can be used by an unauthenticated or authenticated attacker
to query otherwise unreachable internal network resources. As demonstrated in
the corresponding blog post, using this vulnerability, it is possible to i.e.
(amongst others) send out fully customized emails or modify the application's
resource settings.


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to v12.5 Build 16342
