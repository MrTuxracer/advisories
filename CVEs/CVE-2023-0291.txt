(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The plugin offers the ajax action "qsm_remove_file_fd_question" to unauthenticated
users which accepts a "media_id" parameter pointing to a any item uploaded through
WordPress' media upload functionality. However, this "media_id" is afterward used
in a forced wp_delete_attachment() call ultimately deleteing the media from the
WordPress instance.

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to delete any (and all)
uploaded WordPress media files.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
The following Proof-of-Concept would delete the uploaded media with the ID "1":
