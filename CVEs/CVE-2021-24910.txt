RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Transposh WordPress Translation 1.0.7 and below


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Transposh translation filter for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog
translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic translation with human
translation aided by your users with an easy to use in-context interface.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The plugin's ajax action "tp_tp" is vulnerable to an unauthenticated/authenticated
reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when user-supplied input to the HTTP
GET parameter "q" is processed by the web application. Since the application does
not properly validate and sanitize this parameter, it is possible to place
arbitrary script code onto the same page.

This offers a wide range of possible attacks such as redirecting the user to a
malicious page, spoofing content on the page or attacking the browser and its
plugins. Since all session-relevant cookies are protected by HTTPOnly, it is not
possible to hijack sessions.


6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
The following PoC triggers a JavaScript alert:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=tp_tp&e=g&m=s&tl=en&q=<img%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert(document.cookie)>


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to Transposh 1.0.8.1
